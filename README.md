## Purpose for Tip Calculator using JQuery

When you are going to hotel or restaurant, you just give tips... Right?

So If you don't know how to count tips per person (or who will be paying - how many money?). In this case you need to find out per person contribution. I have made a [friendly tip calculator](https://keerthi-mani.github.io/Tip-Calculator/) which includes facilty for bill amount, Tip in percentage(%), Number of people in group. Just enter above details & it will show you Tips per person and Total per person.

## Technologies Used

- Html
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JQuery

## Calculate the tip amount per person

```
    var tips = amount * (tipPercentage / 100);
    var totalAmount = tips + amount;
    var amountPerPerson = totalAmount / numberOfPersons;

```
